        <h4>Kare was the graphic and typographic designer behind the first ever <br> Apple Macintosh interface elements and typefaces in 1983.<br>
        She designed the first pixelated icons for Apple's computers 30 <br> years ago with no prior technological knowledge <br>eventually also designing for Facebook and PayPal. 
        </h4>
     <p>In the early 1980s, 
        Kare joined Apple Computer where she was a member of the original Apple Macintosh design team. 
        The company primarily hired her into Macintosh 
        software group and she was assigned the job 
        to design user interface graphics and fonts. <br> <br>
        Soon after, she was promoted to the post of a Creative Director.<br> 
        She worked under the Director of that organization, Tom Suiter in Apple Creative Services. For the Macintosh operating system, Kare designed many typefaces, original marketing material and icons. The modified and revised versions of her original groundbreaking designs are still present in many computer graphics tools. 
        For instance, her ingeniously designed icons such as the Lasso, the Grabber and the Paint Bucket are still used with some modification.<br> Kares most notable works from her time with Apple are the Chicago typeface. It was the most prominent typeface for the user interface, applied not only in Classic Mac OS but also the first four generations of Apple iPod interface. 
        <br> <br>Another one of her recognizable creations were the original monospace Monaco typeface and Geneva typeface. 
        Besides, her long list of original creations include the symbol on the Command key on Apple keyboards, the welcome screen icon the Happy Mac that greeted the users when the machine is turned on and Clarus the Dogcow.</p>
        <p>After completing her tenure at Apple Computers, Kare accepted the job offer as a designer for NeXT. <br> <br>
         There she served the clients such as Microsoft and IBM. Working with Microsoft she managed the card deck for Windows 3.0s solitaire game project. She also designed multiple icons for the Windows 3.0. <br> 
         Quite a number of icons she designed for Microsoft remained unchanged until Windows XP, such as Notepad and various Control Panels icons. Facebook also requested her to design their Gift icon for their site in 2007. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
